/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) What is the cost for 12 hours work?
 *
 * 2) The plumber sometimes issues discount coupons.
 *    Add a fourth parameter to the totalCost
 *    function definition to account for discounts.
 *
 * 3) Update the function to subtract the discount
 *    from the total before returning it.
 *
 * 4) If a customer has a $20 off coupon,
 *    update the call to totalCost
 *    to display the total cost.
 *    It should now be $130 for 3 hours.
