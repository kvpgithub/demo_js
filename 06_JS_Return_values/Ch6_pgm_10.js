/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add an items property to both players.
 *    e.g. items: "a rusty key, a piece of cheese"
 *
 * 2) Create a getPlayerItems function to return
 *    a sensible string including the items.
 *
 * 3) Update the getPlayerInfo function to
 *    include a call to getPlayerItems.
 *
 * 4) Change the two calls to getPlayerInfo
 *    so they also pass the items property
 *    as an argument.
