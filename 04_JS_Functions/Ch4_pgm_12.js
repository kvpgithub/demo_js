/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a fourth sale object.
 *
 * 2) Update the code so that tax is calculated
 *    and the new sale is displayed.
 *
 * Having two separate functions to calculate tax
 * and display sales is good, each has a specific purpose.
 * Having to call both functions
 * for each sale object is not so good.
 *
 * 3) Can you change the code so that you don't
 *    have to call both functions for every sale?
